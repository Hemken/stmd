The general scheme for writing commands will be something like this         
(see `help language`, this is a pared down version):                        
                                                                            
````                                                                        
[prefix:] command [varlist] [if] [, options]                                
````                                                                        
                                                                            
For example, try:                                                           
                                                                            
```{stata, eval=FALSE}                                                      
help summarize                                                              
```                                                                         
                                                                            
and you will see                                                            
                                                                            
````                                                                        
summarize [varlist] [if] [in] [weight] [, options]                          
````                                                                        
                                                                            
The name of the command is *summarize*.  It can be abbreviated as           
short as *su* (although *sum* is more common in practice).  This is         
indicated by the underlining.                                               
                                                                            
This command takes ("accepts") a *variable list*.  The square brackets      
indicate that the variable list is actually optional for this command,      
as is everything besides the command name, *summarize*.                     
                                                                            
Having loaded a data set, we can try out this command                       
                                                                            
```

summarize                                                                   
<</dd_do>>                                                                  
```

## *Varlist*                                                                
                                                                            
Next we add a variable list.  There are a number of ways we can             
write lists of variables in Stata.  (See `help varlist`.)                   
                                                                            
- write out the variable name(s)                                            
- use wildcards                                                             
- use a first-to-last (sequential) list                                     
- the keyword `_all`                                                        
                                                                            
```                                                                         
<<dd_do>>                                                                   
summarize price mpg // spelled-out list                                     
summarize mpg - trunk // first-to-last list                                 
summarize *n   // wildcard list                                             
summarize _all // or use " * "

```

Some languages have indexed lists, like *myvar1-myvar4*, meaning the        
four variables myvar1, myvar2, myvar3, and myvar4, regardless of where      
they are located in the data set.  Not Stata.  In Stata this would be       
a first-to-last (positional) list.  It might be the list you want, or       
it might not - it depends how the data set was constructed.                 
                                                                            
### Exercise                                                                
How else could you specify the list with myvar1, myvar2, myvar3, and        
myvar4?  (State any assumptions you make.)                                  
                                                                            
## *If*                                                                     
An `if` condition allows your command to act on a *subset* of the           
observations in your data set.  (See `help if`.)  The syntax for            
most commands can be                                                        
                                                                            
````                                                                        
command if expression                                                       
````                                                                        
                                                                            
where *expression* is something that is true or false for each observation  
in the data set.                                                            
                                                                            
For example, to see the average price of a foreign car in this              
data set we might try                                                       
                                                                            
```
