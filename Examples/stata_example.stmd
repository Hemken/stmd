Using Stata dynamic tags in a text file with the dyndoc command
===============================================================

Let us consider an example where we study the **mpg** and **weight** variables
in **auto.dta**.  In our examples below, we will first write the commands so
that they will be displayed in our target HTML file.  Then, we will write the
commands so that Stata will process the Stata dynamic tags, displaying the
results of the Stata commands in the target HTML file.


We first use the **sysuse** command to load the dataset and then describe
the data using the **describe** command. 

~~~~
```{stata}
sysuse auto, clear
describe
```
~~~~

This produces the following Stata results:

```{stata}
sysuse auto, clear
describe
```

Now, we want to check if **mpg** is always greater than 0 and less than 100.
We use the **assert** command to perform the check.  In this case, we do not
want to include any output in the target HTML file, so we use the 
**echo=FALSE, results="hide"**
attributes to modify the output of the code block.  
Alternatively, we could specify **quietly**.    

~~~~
```{stata, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
assert mpg > 0 & mpg < 100
```
~~~~

This is executed immediately after this line.

```{stata, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
assert mpg > 0 & mpg < 100
```

If the data had not satisfied the conditions, **dyndoc** would have failed with an error
message, as would occur if we ran the same **assert** command in a do-file. 


Next, we want to summarize the **weight** variable:

~~~~
```{stata}
summarize weight
```
~~~~

This produces the following in the target HTML file:

```{stata}
summarize weight
```

We want to use the minimum and maximum values of **weight** in a sentence.
Instead of copying and pasting the numbers from the **summarize** output, we can
use the **dd_display** Stata dynamic tag with the **r(min)** and **r(max)**
stored results:

~~~~
> The variable weight has minimum value `s %4.2f r(min)` and 
has maximum value `s %4.2f `r(max)'`.
~~~~

This produces the following in the target HTML file:

> The variable weight has minimum value `s %4.2f r(min)` and 
has maximum value `s %4.2f r(max)`.


The **dd_display** dynamic tag uses Stata's **display** command to evaluate
expressions.  It can be used as a calculator. For example, if we want to
include the $$range = max - min$$ in a sentence, instead of calculating the
number and then copying and pasting it, we can use 

~~~~
> The variable weight has range `s %4.2f r(max)-r(min)`.
~~~~

which produces the following in the target HTML file:

> The variable weight has range `s %4.2f r(max)-r(min)`.

Now, we want to graph **mpg** and **weight** using a scatterplot.  We use the
**dd_do** tag with the **nooutput** attribute to generate the scatterplot
first.  The **nooutput** attribute leaves just the command in the output,

~~~~
```{stata, nooutput}
scatter mpg weight, mcolor(blue%50)
```
~~~~

which generates a scatterplot of **mpg** and **weight** with 50% opacity 
color markers.

```{stata, nooutput}
scatter mpg weight, mcolor(blue%50)
```

This should have exported the graph to a file and included an image link to the
HTML file.
